The party applying for permission must make all necessary enquiries, and take all necessary steps, to ensure that the foreign country or territory where the person is giving evidence raises no objection, to the giving of evidence in that country or territory for Court proceedings in Singapore. This may be done by any means that the party considers appropriate, including:

> (a) obtaining advice from a foreign lawyer qualified to advise on the laws of the relevant foreign country or territory;
>
> (b) making enquiries with the relevant authorities; or
>
> (c) obtaining permission from the relevant foreign country or territory, in accordance with any applicable procedure, for evidence to be given by a person located in that country or territory through a live video or live television link, if such permission is required.

(3) An application for the issue of a letter of request, to the relevant authorities of a foreign jurisdiction, for permission for evidence to be given by live video link or live television link by a person located in that jurisdiction, if not contained in an application mentioned in sub- paragraph (1), must be made expeditiously and, in any case, unless the Court otherwise directs, not later than 8 weeks before the date of commencement of the hearing at which the person is to give evidence.

_**References to exhibits in text of affidavit**_

### 81. Affirming and signing of affidavits in Singapore before, and completing of attestation by, commissioner for oaths through live video link or live television link <a href="#id-81-affirming-and-signing-of-affidavits-in-singapore-before-and-completing-of-attestation-by-commissi" id="id-81-affirming-and-signing-of-affidavits-in-singapore-before-and-completing-of-attestation-by-commissi"></a>

(1) A remote communication technology mentioned in Order 15, Rule 22(1) of the Rules of Court 2021 must be capable of creating a live video link or live television link through which a commissioner for oaths is able to do all of the things mentioned in Order 15, Rule 22(3) of the Rules of Court 2021.

(2) For the purposes of Order 15, Rule 22(2) of the Rules of Court 2021, the maker of the affidavit and the commissioner for oaths may sign the affidavit electronically by applying a security procedure that results in a secure electronic signature under section 18 of the Electronic Transactions Act 2010.

(3) Where an affidavit is made pursuant to Order 15, Rule 22 of the Rules of Court 2021, the affidavit should be made, as far as possible, as if the maker of the affidavit were appearing before the commissioner for oaths in person, and the attestation must state that the affidavit was affirmed and signed in Singapore with the maker of the affidavit appearing before the commissioner for oaths through a live video link or live television link, or that the affidavit was signed by the maker of the affidavit and/or the commissioner for oaths electronically in Singapore, or both, as the case may be.

### 82. Affirming of documents by persons who do not understand English, are illiterate or blind <a href="#id-82-affirming-of-documents-by-persons-who-do-not-understand-english-are-illiterate-or-blind" id="id-82-affirming-of-documents-by-persons-who-do-not-understand-english-are-illiterate-or-blind"></a>

(1) Rule 8 of the Commissioners for Oaths Rules restricts solicitors who are appointed as commissioners for oaths to taking affidavits or statutory declarations, or administering oaths, for persons who speak and understand English, or, in the solicitor’s discretion, for persons who speak and understand a language or dialect other than English in which the solicitor is proficient.

(2) As commissioners for oaths are under a duty to ensure that the maker of the affidavit understands the document being affirmed, where the maker of the affidavit is not able to understand English, is illiterate or blind, the commissioner for oaths is obliged to ensure that the following requirements under Order 15, Rule 24 of the Rules of Court 2021 are met:

> **Safeguards for persons who do not understand English, are illiterate or blind (O. 15, r. 24)**
>
> **24.**&#x57;here the maker of the affidavit is not able to understand English, is illiterate or blind, the commissioner for oaths must certify on the affidavit that —
>
> > (a) the affidavit was read in the commissioner for oaths’ presence to the maker in a language or dialect that the maker understands;
> >
> > (b) the person who did the translation was competent to do so;
> >
> > (c) the maker indicated that he or she understood the affidavit and confirmed its contents; and
> >
> > (d) the maker signed or placed his or her fingerprint willingly in the commissioner for oaths’ presence to affirm the affidavit.

(3) Sub-paragraph (2) also applies to persons who do not understand English, are illiterate or are blind, and who are brought before a Supreme Court commissioner for oaths. In such a case, the necessary steps referred to in Order 15, Rule 24 of the Rules of Court 2021 may take a considerable time and may cause long delays for other persons who wish to take affidavits or statutory declarations before the Supreme Court commissioner for oaths.

(4) Accordingly, solicitors who wish to bring such persons before the Supreme Court commissioner for oaths should first estimate the time that will be taken to interpret or read the documents to be affirmed. If it is estimated that the total time required for interpretation or reading of the documents will be more than 20 minutes, the solicitor must contact the appropriate Head Interpreter and arrange for a special appointment for the documents to be affirmed. The solicitor should not bring the intended maker of the affidavit before the Supreme Court commissioner for oaths without such an appointment.

(5) If such a person is brought before the Supreme Court commissioner for oaths and the interpretation or reading of the documents takes more than 20 minutes, the commissioner for oaths will refer the solicitor and the intended maker of the affidavit to the appropriate Head Interpreter for a special appointment to be made for the documents to be affirmed.

(6) The appropriate Head Interpreter may be contacted at the following telephone numbers:

> (a) Head Interpreter (Chinese languages) – 6332 3940.
>
> (b) Head Interpreter (Indian languages) – 6332 3930.
>
> (c) Head Interpreter (Malay languages) – 6332 3970.

(2) The notice in Form B13 should set out all the objections to the contents of affidavits of evidence-in-chief that will be raised at the hearing of the cause or matter and all the grounds of the objections.

(3) An adjudication on the material objected to in affidavits of evidence-in-chief filed pursuant to an order of court should only be sought at the trial or hearing of the cause or matter for which the affidavits of evidence-in-chief were filed, and not before. If an adjudication is sought prior to the trial or hearing of the cause or matter, the application for the adjudication will be adjourned to be dealt with at the trial or hearing of the cause or matter, and the applicant may be ordered to pay the costs of the adjournment.
