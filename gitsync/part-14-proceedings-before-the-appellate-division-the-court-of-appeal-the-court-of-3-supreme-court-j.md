### 116. Application of this Part <a href="#id-116-application-of-this-part" id="id-116-application-of-this-part"></a>

The directions in this Part apply to all appeals, applications and other proceedings before:

> (a) the Court of Appeal;
>
> (b) the Appellate Division;
>
> (c) the Court of 3 Supreme Court Judges under the Legal Profession Act 1966; and
>
> (d) the General Division under section 55 of the Medical Registration Act 1997.

### 117. Whether an appeal to the Court of Appeal is to be heard by 5 or any greater uneven number of Judges <a href="#id-117-whether-an-appeal-to-the-court-of-appeal-is-to-be-heard-by-5-or-any-greater-uneven-number-of-jud" id="id-117-whether-an-appeal-to-the-court-of-appeal-is-to-be-heard-by-5-or-any-greater-uneven-number-of-jud"></a>

Pursuant to section 50(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1969, the Court of Appeal may determine, as and when appropriate, whether to convene a panel of 5 or any greater uneven number of Judges. Such determination of the Court of Appeal will be final.

### 117A. Applications that may be made either to the General Division or an appellate Court <a href="#id-117a-applications-that-may-be-made-either-to-the-general-division-or-an-appellate-court" id="id-117a-applications-that-may-be-made-either-to-the-general-division-or-an-appellate-court"></a>

(1) Where an application may be made either to the General Division or to an appellate Court (being the Appellate Division or the Court of Appeal), and the application is first made to the General Division pursuant to section 39 or 57 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1969:

> (a) if the application is refused by the General Division, and the applicant still wishes to obtain the relief sought in the refused application, the applicant should make an application to the appellate Court for the same relief, instead of filing an appeal to the appellate Court; and
>
> (b) in any event, any party who wishes to vary or discharge any direction or order made by the General Division on the application should likewise make an application to the appellate Court to vary or discharge that direction or order, instead of filing an appeal to the appellate Court.

(2) Except as provided in sub-paragraph (1), any party who is dissatisfied with a decision of the General Division may file an appeal to the appellate Court against that decision in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1969 and the applicable rules of civil procedure.

### 117B. Submissions by leading and junior assisting counsel <a href="#id-117a-applications-that-may-be-made-either-to-the-general-division-or-an-appellate-court" id="id-117a-applications-that-may-be-made-either-to-the-general-division-or-an-appellate-court"></a>

(1)&#x20;Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 96 of these Practice Directions, in the event that a party is represented by more than one counsel in the conduct of proceedings under this Part, junior assisting counsel are ordinarily expected to make part of the submissions at any oral hearing.

(2)&#x20;Lead counsel is to inform the Court at the start of the oral hearing which issues would be addressed by the lead counsel or the junior assisting counsel.

(3)&#x20;Unless otherwise directed by the Court,

> (a)> &#x20;counsel should ensure that he or she confines himself or herself to the issues to be addressed and that there is no overlap in the issues being dealt with by different counsel for the same party; and
>
> (b)> &#x20;counsel must not repeat, clarify or expand on any submissions that have been made by another counsel for the same party.

(4)&#x20;Nothing in this paragraph detracts from the responsibility of lead counsel to ensure that all counsel making submissions are adequately supervised and able to handle the tasks assigned to them.

### 118. Appeals Information Sheet for civil appeals to the Appellate Division and the Court of Appeal <a href="#id-118-appeals-information-sheet-for-civil-appeals-to-the-appellate-division-and-the-court-of-appeal" id="id-118-appeals-information-sheet-for-civil-appeals-to-the-appellate-division-and-the-court-of-appeal"></a>

(1) The Chief Justice has directed that for civil appeals to the Appellate Division and civil appeals to the Court of Appeal, parties must file in court and serve on every other party to the appeal or his or her solicitor an Appeals Information Sheet in Form B19 of Appendix B of these Practice Directions by the following times:

> (a) for appeals under Order 19 of the Rules of Court 2021 – at the same time as when parties’ respective Cases under Order 19, Rule 30 of the Rules of Court 2021 are filed and served; and
>
> (b) for appeals under Order 18 of the Rules of Court 2021 – at the same time as when parties’ written submissions under Order 18, Rule 33 of the Rules of Court 2021 are filed and served.

(2) Where appropriate, parties or their solicitors may be required to attend in person to take directions on the conduct of the appeal.

### 121. Preparation of records of appeal, written Cases, written submissions and core bundles <a href="#id-121-preparation-of-records-of-appeal-written-cases-written-submissions-and-core-bundles" id="id-121-preparation-of-records-of-appeal-written-cases-written-submissions-and-core-bundles"></a>

_**Arrangement of appeal records**_

(1) This sub-paragraph sets out the manner of arranging appeal records.

> (a) To facilitate cross-referencing, the record of appeal must be arranged in the following separate volumes:
>
> > (i) **Volume I** – A certified copy of the judgment or grounds of decision of the lower Court and the extracted order of the lower Court.
> >
> > (ii) **Volume II** – Notice of appeal, certificate of security for costs and pleadings (to include all originating processes).
> >
> > (iii) **Volume III** – Affidavits (in chronological order), and transcripts or notes of evidence and arguments.
> >
> > (iv) **Volume IV** – All such exhibits and documents as they were tendered in the lower Court, but which did not form an exhibit to any affidavit.
> >
> > (v) **Volume V** – The Agreed Bundle (if any) in its original physical form as it was tendered in the lower Court.
>
> (b) Where there are no exhibits or documents referred to in sub-paragraph (1)(a)(iv) above, Volume IV need not be produced, and Volume V must be renumbered as Volume IV.
>
> (c) To facilitate cross-referencing, any supplemental record of appeal must be arranged in the following manner in 1 volume:
>
> > (i) the notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal;
> >
> > (ii) the certificate of payment of security for costs in respect of the appeal to the Court of Appeal;
> >
> > (iii) the written judgment or grounds of decision of the Appellate Division or, if there is no judgment or grounds of decision, the certified minute sheet of the Appellate Division;
> >
> > (iv) the order granting permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal;
> >
> > (v) parties’ Cases filed in the Appellate Division; and
> >
> > (vi) all documents filed in the Appellate Division (so far as they are relevant to the matter decided and the nature of the appeal).
>
> (d) If any volume should exceed 300 pages, then that volume must be sub-divided, at a convenient page, into sub-volumes designated as part thereof, for example, Volume III Part A, Volume III Part B and so on. Conversely, if any of the volumes (with the exception of Volumes I and II which must remain as separate volumes) should be less than 100 pages each, these may be amalgamated into combined volumes, each not exceeding 300 pages, and renumbered accordingly.

_**Pagination in soft copy**_

(2) This sub-paragraph sets out the manner of paginating soft copy appeal records.

> (a) The first page of each volume must state the title and the Civil Appeal number of the appeal, the names of the parties, the volume number, a short description of its contents, the names and addresses of the appellants and respondents, and the date of filing.
>
> (b) All pages (including, where applicable, the cover page, table of contents, separator sheets and exhibit sheets) must be paginated in the manner provided for in paragraph 120(2)(c), and, where there are multiple volumes, each separate volume must start at page 1, and every page in that volume must be numbered consecutively.

_**Table of contents**_

(3) This sub-paragraph sets out the format of the table of contents for appeal records.

> (a) The table of contents of all volumes of the records must be placed at the beginning of Volume I, immediately after the first title page in the manner and form set out in Form B20 of Appendix B of these Practice Directions.
>
> (b) Each volume and, if any, parts thereof, must also contain its own table of contents listing the documents contained in the volume.
>
> (c) Items in the table of contents page must be numbered serially, and listed in the order in which they are found in the records.
>
> (d) The items relating to the transcripts or notes of the evidence of witnesses must have a sub-table of contents page of the evidence of each witness, and the number and name of each witness must be shown in such sub-table.
>
> (e) If an exhibit consists of a bundle of documents, then the documents in the bundle must be listed in a sub-table of contents under the item relating to such bundle.
>
> (f) Electronic bookmarks for each item of the table of contents and sub-table of contents must be added to each volume of the Portable Document Format (PDF) version of the appeal records. The description of each bookmark must correspond with the description of that item in the table of contents or sub-table of contents, unless an abbreviated description is appropriate.

(4) \[deleted]

_**Arrangement of the appellant’s and respondent’s core bundles of documents and the second core bundle**_

(5) The documents to be included in the appellant’s and respondent’s core bundles of documents and the second core bundle are stipulated in Order 19, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court 2021. The contents of the appellant’s core bundle of documents must be arranged in the following separate volumes:

> (a) **Volume A** – A certified copy of the judgment or grounds of decision of the lower Court, the extracted order of the lower Court, and a contents page listing the documents included therein.
>
> (b) **Volume B** – All other documents referred to in Order 19, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court 2021 and a table of contents listing the documents included therein.

Each volume of the appellant’s and respondent’s core bundles of documents and the second core bundle must start at page 1, every page in that volume must be numbered consecutively, and all pages (including, where applicable, the cover page, table of contents, separator sheets and exhibit sheets) must be paginated in the manner provided for in paragraph 120(2)(c).

_**Contents page for appellant’s and respondent’s core bundles of documents and the second core bundle**_

(6) Any document listed in the contents page of the appellant’s and respondent’s core bundles of documents and the second core bundle must be suitably described in such a manner as to allow the Court to identify the nature of the document. Examples of suitable descriptions are set out below for reference:

> (a) Joint Venture Agreement between Party A and Party B dated 1 December 2017;
>
> (b) Minutes of meeting held on 1 December 2017 between Party A and Party B; and
>
> (c) Email dated 1 December 2017 from Party A to Party B.

Parties should avoid the use of generic descriptions such as “extracts from the affidavit of Party A filed on 1 December 2017” or “exhibits from the affidavit of Party A filed on 1 December 2017”.

_**Contents of the appellant’s and respondent’s core bundles of documents and the second core bundle**_

(7) Parties must ensure that all documents which they refer to in their submissions (whether in their Cases or in the oral submissions) are contained in their core bundles or the second core bundle. As a matter of practice, parties should not be making submissions based on documents contained solely in the record of appeal or the supplemental record of appeal unless they are responding to questions from the coram.

_**Responsibility for good order and completeness of appeal records**_

(8) The solicitor having the conduct of the appeal may delegate the preparation of the appeal records to an assistant or a suitably experienced law clerk or secretary, provided always that the solicitor must personally satisfy himself or herself as to the good order and completeness of every copy of the appeal records lodged in Court in accordance with the above directions, and must personally bear responsibility for any errors or deficiencies.

_**Superfluous, irrelevant or duplicative documents**_

(9) With regard to the inclusion of documents, the attention of solicitors is drawn to the definitions of “record of appeal”, “core bundle of documents” and “second core bundle” in Order 19, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court 2021. Only documents which are relevant to the subject matter of the appeal must be included in the appeal records.

(10) Parties are reminded not to exhibit duplicate documents in their respondent’s core bundle of documents or the second core bundle if such documents are already included in a core bundle of documents that has been filed earlier. Documents must not appear more than once in the record of appeal, even if exhibited to different affidavits.

(11) The Appellate Division or the Court of Appeal (as the case may be) will have no hesitation in making a special order for costs in cases in which it is of the opinion that costs have been wasted by the inclusion of superfluous, irrelevant or duplicative documents.

_**Preparation of Cases and written submissions**_

(12) Any document referred to in written submissions filed in appeals to the Appellate Division and the Court of Appeal under Order 18 of the Rules of Court 2021 and in an appellant’s Case, respondent’s Case and the appellant’s Reply filed in appeals to the Appellate Division and the Court of Appeal under Order 19 of the Rules of Court 2021 must be suitably described in such a manner as to allow the Court to identify the nature of the document.

### 123. Inclusion in appeal bundles of documents ordered to be sealed or redacted <a href="#id-123-inclusion-in-appeal-bundles-of-documents-ordered-to-be-sealed-or-redacted" id="id-123-inclusion-in-appeal-bundles-of-documents-ordered-to-be-sealed-or-redacted"></a>

(1) This paragraph applies where certain documents tendered before the lower Court have been ordered to be sealed or redacted, unless the entire case file in the Appellate Division or the Court of Appeal (as the case may be) has been sealed from public inspection.

(2) Counsel should carefully consider whether it is necessary to include in the record of appeal (or, in the case of a further appeal from the Appellate Division, the supplemental record of appeal), the appellant’s core bundle of documents, the respondent’s core bundle of documents or the second core bundle (collectively known as “appeal bundles”) any document that has been ordered to be sealed or redacted, having regard to paragraph 121(9) of these Practice Directions.

_**Inclusion of redacted documents in appeal bundles**_

(3) Where it is necessary to include in the appeal bundles documents that have been ordered to be redacted, parties must do so by complying with the following directions:

> (a) All documents subjected to a redaction order must not be included in the appeal bundles in their unredacted form. Instead, such documents should be included in the appeal bundles in their redacted form.
>
> (b) In the margins against the redacted portions of the appeal bundles, the basis for the redaction must be stated (for example, “This information has been redacted pursuant to HC/ORC 100/2022 made on 4 April 2022”).
>
> (c) The parties are required to prepare a separate bundle, consisting only of documents subjected to a redaction order. These documents must be included in this bundle in their unredacted form (the “Bundle of Documents Subjected to Redaction Order” or “BDSRO”). To avoid doubt, parties are not to include any information or documents which have been expunged from the Court’s records.
>
> (d) The BDSRO must be tendered in both hard copies and soft copies. Where hard copies are concerned, parties must tender the number of copies as provided in paragraph 122(7) and (9) of these Practice Directions. Where soft copies are concerned, the BDSRO may be included in the CD-ROM mentioned in paragraph 122(8) and (11) of these Practice Directions and must be named in the format provided in paragraph 122(16) of these Practice Directions.
>
> (e) The BDSRO must contain a table of contents. The format of the table of contents must comply with that provided in paragraph 121(3) of these Practice Directions.
>
> (f) The pagination of the documents in the BDSRO must follow the pagination of the corresponding documents in the appeal bundles. Fresh pagination should not be assigned to the documents in the BDSRO.
>
> (g) At the time when the parties tender and electronically file (where such electronic filing is required) the appeal bundles and the BDSRO, they must by way of a letter to the Registry: (i) inform the Registry that the BDSRO contains redacted information, (ii) specify the basis for the redaction; and (iii) request that the Registry seal the BDSRO in the electronic case file and keep the hard copies from public inspection. The letter is to be sent to the Registry both by way of hard copy and by way of electronic filing at the same time as when hard copies of the BDSRO are tendered.

(4) Solicitors are reminded of their responsibility under paragraph 121(8) to personally satisfy themselves as to the good order of the appeal records. At the time the appeal bundles and BDSRO are tendered, the solicitor having conduct of the appeal must electronically file an undertaking to the Court that he or she has satisfied himself or herself that the appeal bundles do not contain any document ordered to be redacted in its unredacted form. The undertaking must be in Form B23 of Appendix B of these Practice Directions.

_**Inclusion of sealed documents in appeal bundles**_

(5) Where it is necessary to include in the appeal bundles documents that have been ordered to be sealed, parties must do so by complying with the following directions:

> (a) All documents subjected to a sealing order must not be included in the appeal bundles. Instead, each and every such document should be represented in the appeal bundles by a separate holding page.
>
> (b) Each and every holding page should be blank save that: (i) the basis for the sealing must be stated across each holding page (for example, “The affidavit of Tan filed on 1 April 2022 has been sealed pursuant to HC/ORC 100/2022 made on 4 April 2022”); and (ii) the cross references required under sub-paragraph 5(f) must be indicated (for example, “Reference: BDSSO – Pages 1-10”).
>
> (c) The parties are required to prepare a separate bundle, consisting only of documents subjected to a sealing order (the “Bundle of Documents Subjected to Sealing Order” or “BDSSO”).
>
> (d) The BDSSO must be tendered both in hard copies and soft copies. Where hard copies are concerned, parties must tender the number of copies as is provided in paragraph 122(7) and (9) of these Practice Directions. Where soft copies are concerned, the BDSSO may be included in the CD-ROM mentioned in paragraph 122(8) and (11) of these Practice Directions and must be named in the format provided in paragraph 122(16) of these Practice Directions.
>
> (e) The BDSSO must contain a table of contents. The format of the table of contents must comply with that provided in paragraph 121(3) of these Practice Directions.
>
> (f) Given that each and every document subjected to a sealing order is represented only by a single holding page in the appeal bundles but is reproduced in full in the BDSSO, fresh pagination will have to be assigned to the pages in the BDSSO. Each holding page must contain cross references to the pages of the BDSSO that the holding page represents (for example, “Reference: BDSSO – Pages 1-10”).
>
> (g) At the time when the parties tender and electronically file (where such electronic filing is required) the appeal bundles and the BDSSO, they must by way of a letter to the Registry: (i) inform the Registry that the BDSSO contains documents ordered to be sealed, (ii) specify the basis for the sealing; and (iii) request that the Registry seal the BDSSO in the electronic case file and keep the hard copies from public inspection. The letter is to be sent to the Registry both by way of hard copy and by way of electronic filing at the same time as when the hard copies of the BDSSO are tendered.

(6) Solicitors are reminded of their responsibility under paragraph 121(8) to personally satisfy themselves as to the good order of the appeal records. At the time the appeal bundles and the BDSSO are tendered, the solicitor having conduct of the appeal must electronically file an undertaking to the Court that he or she has satisfied himself or herself that the appeal bundles do not contain any document ordered to be sealed. The undertaking must be in Form B23 of Appendix B of these Practice Directions.

(7) To avoid doubt, documents that have been ordered to be expunged should not in any event be tendered to the Appellate Division or the Court of Appeal in any form.

Where the Appellate Division or the Court of Appeal (as the case may be) orders further written submissions to be filed for any civil matter, such written submissions must not exceed 10 pages unless otherwise directed by the Appellate Division or the Court of Appeal (as the case may be).

(3) In relation to applications referred to under section 192 of the Legal Profession Act 1966, if no affidavits or submission are filed by the relevant prescribed timelines, the Court of 3 Supreme Court Judges will proceed on the basis that the party does not intend to file any affidavit or submissions and may, in accordance with section 192 of the Legal Profession Act 1966 decide the matter based on the documents before it without hearing oral arguments.

### 127. Use of presentation slides for all proceedings before the Appellate Division, Court of Appeal and Court of 3 Supreme Court Judges under the Legal Profession Act 1966 and appeals to the General Division under the Medical Registration Act 1997 <a href="#id-127-use-of-presentation-slides-for-all-proceedings-before-the-appellate-division-court-of-appeal-and" id="id-127-use-of-presentation-slides-for-all-proceedings-before-the-appellate-division-court-of-appeal-and"></a>

(1) Where a Grant of Aid lapses or is cancelled in the course of any proceedings in the Appellate Division or the Court of Appeal, counsel must promptly notify the Appellate Division or the Court of Appeal (as the case may be) of the lapse or the cancellation in writing. This is given that questions may arise from the lapse or the cancellation of a Grant of Aid as to whether security for costs would need to be furnished to enable the proceedings in the Appellate Division or the Court of Appeal (as the case may be) to continue to be pursued.

(2) To avoid doubt, “Grant of Aid” in sub-paragraph (1) means a document issued under section 8 of the Legal Aid and Advice Act 1995 stating that legal aid is granted to a person (whether on a provisional basis or otherwise).

This affidavit is to be made by the applicant’s counsel (if the applicant is represented by counsel when the affidavit is filed) or by the applicant (if the applicant is not represented by counsel when the affidavit is filed). Where the applicant is represented by one or more counsel, a separate affidavit may be made by each counsel as the deponent or a joint affidavit may be made by all of the counsel as deponents.

(2) Every affidavit mentioned in sub-paragraph (1) must attach as an exhibit an information sheet in Form B29A of Appendix B of these Practice Directions. The information sheet must be completed and signed by the person who makes the affidavit.
